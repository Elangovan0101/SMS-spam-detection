SMS Spam Detection
Introduction
Welcome to the SMS Spam Classifier project! This project is designed to help users identify whether a given SMS message is spam or not. With the ever-increasing number of unwanted and potentially harmful messages being sent via SMS, having a reliable classifier can be invaluable in protecting users from scams, phishing attempts, and other malicious activities.

Using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) methods, this classifier analyzes the content of SMS messages to determine whether they exhibit characteristics commonly associated with spam. Leveraging the power of Naive Bayes classification algorithms and TF-IDF vectorization, the model can accurately classify messages as either spam or non-spam (ham), providing users with a quick and reliable means of identifying potentially harmful content.

Whether you're a user looking to safeguard your inbox from unwanted messages or a developer interested in exploring machine learning techniques for text classification, the SMS Spam Classifier project offers a powerful and intuitive solution for detecting and filtering out spam messages in real-time.
